/// A client implementation capable of interfacing between an ``AuthenticatorProtocol`` authenticator and the Web Authentication API.
///
/// - Important: Unless you specifically need to implement a custom WebAuthn client, it is vastly preferable to reach for the built-in [AuthenticationServices](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices) framework instead, which provides out-of-the-box support for a user's [Passkey](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/public-private_key_authentication/supporting_passkeys). However, this is not always possible or preferrable to use this credential, especially when you want to implement silent account creation, and wish to build it off of WebAuthn. For those cases, `WebAuthnClient` is available.
///
/// Registration: To create a registration credential, first ask the relying party (aka the server) for ``PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions``, then pass those to ``createRegistrationCredential(options:minTimeout:maxTimeout:origin:supportedPublicKeyCredentialParameters:attestRegistration:)`` along with a closure that can generate credentials from configured ``AuthenticatorProtocol`` types such as ``KeyPairAuthenticator`` by passing the provided ``AttestationRegistration`` to ``AuthenticatorProtocol/makeCredentials(with:)``, making sure to persist the resulting ``AuthenticatorProtocol/CredentialSource`` in some way. Finally, pass the resulting ``RegistrationCredential`` back to the relying party to finish registration.
/// Authentication: To retrieve an authentication credential, first ask the relying party (aka the server) for ``PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions``, then pass those to ``getAuthenticationCredential(options:minTimeout:maxTimeout:origin:assertAuthentication:)`` along with a closure that can validate credentials from configured ``AuthenticatorProtocol`` types such as ``KeyPairAuthenticator`` by passing the provided ``AssertionAuthentication`` to ``AuthenticatorProtocol/validateCredentials(with:)``, making sure to persist the resulting ``AuthenticatorProtocol/CredentialSource`` in some way. Finally, pass the resulting ``AuthenticationCredential`` back to the relying party to finish registration.
